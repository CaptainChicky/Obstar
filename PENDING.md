# Pending & Decisions

Only what is still **open**: things needing a human call, things nobody has watched happen, and
values that look wrong until you know why they are what they are. The active work plan is
**[plan.md](plan.md)**; deliberate departures from diep are in **README.md → "Departures from
diep"**; the codebase map and load-bearing invariants (the two frictions, `weight` vs `push`,
`LETHAL_EPS`, tick categories) are in **[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md)** §3.

**Rule: a finished thing with no nuance left is deleted from this file.**

## Needs a human decision

1. **`H`-key piloting** — designed (see plan.md E4: possess nearest same-team
   Dominator/Mothership, your own tank bleeds `2 + maxHP/500` HP/tick, `H` again releases;
   Mothership capped at 5 min, Dominator uncapped). Open: input-redirect site
   (`net/gameSocket.js` vs `rooms/Room.js`).
2. **Reload quantisation** — we `Math.round()` reload ticks; diep compares a float cycle
   (`Barrel.ts:60`). Dropping the round changes every class's cadence at non-integer point
   counts; two sites (`entities/Player.js` `shoot()`, `test/rooms.js`). Deferred so it isn't a
   second cause in someone's clientDiff golden.
3. **`A₀` 1.47% high** — `physics.html` (2.58825) vs `TankBody.ts:271` (2.55 at our 0-based
   level → coefficient 1.428 not 1.449). One literal in `public/SHARE/Physics.js`. Left on
   physics.html's figure deliberately.
4. **`rules.arenaLive` for 2team/4team** — `dronePosts` are baked at construction; a live arena
   would freeze base layouts at the starting floor. Needs `dronePosts` re-derived from the live
   map before either mode can turn it on.
5. **Tank-vs-shape overlap** — no positional resolution (tank-vs-tank has it); a tank can stand
   inside a shape held off only by knockback.
6. **Base drones** — chase speed is diep's own flat 756 u/s and detect 504 u; never playtested
   (move `BASE_DRONE_LEASH`/`DETECT` if a lap reads unfair, not the speed). Lethality (12
   drones ≈ 0.2 s on a maxed tank) also never judged in a browser.
7. **Sandbox gaps** — party-link invites; arena/shape scaling with player count; bosses after
   50–60 min.
8. **Comment-style cleanup pass** — strip cross-file references/change history, keep functional
   statements. Touches nearly every file; do it as its own commit.
9. **Contact quantisation (D6)** — we prorate per 25 ms tick; diep exchanges once per 40 ms
   tick. Accepted approximation; the exact fix is a per-pair reference-tick guard.
10. **`prize`/coins/respawn XP** — ours (`pow(xp/mlx,1.8)`, `respawnPow 0.9`) vs diep's
    `scoreReward` + `respawnLevel = min(level−1, floor(√level × 3.2796))`. Decide per mode.

## Needs a real browser session (nothing else can settle these)

- **C1 causes 2/3** — muzzle-weld ramp vs the current prediction path under strafing. Do not
  blind-tune; the prediction math is measured and pinned by `test/client.js`.
- **`CONST.CAM_SMOOTH`** — camera lag has no reference anywhere (diepcustom is server-only).
  Protocol: accelerate to top speed, measure steady-state offset from screen centre in grid
  squares (the grid is the ruler — 1 square = 1 gu); repeat at maxed Movement Speed to confirm
  it's linear in speed. Do not guess a number.
- **`CONST.HP_BAR_HOLD`** — damage a Pentagon once, count frames until the bar starts fading.
- **Damage-flash duration** — client re-times its own flash (`sleep(50)`+`sleep(16)`) instead
  of tracking how long the server holds the states[0] bit (~75 ms). Rewrite `hit()` to follow
  the bit; needs eyes on it.
- Sandbox self-levelling, the smasher panels, the class-picker slide-in, and every plan.md
  silhouette fix — one eyeball pass against the six reference webp files at the end.

## Live stand-ins (ours, flagged — don't present as diep numbers)

- **Custom classes with no diep counterpart**: Cyclone, Submachine, Auto Hover, Fortress —
  every column is a nearest-relative stand-in (Cyclone ← Octo, Submachine ← Machine Gun,
  Fortress ← Tri-Trapper/Battleship, auto-turret slots ← `AutoTurret.ts`'s shared def).
- **`weight`/`push` columns for post-Knockbackfactor classes** (Hunter, Predator, Streamliner,
  Stalker, Auto 3/5, Spread Shot, Gunner Trapper, Tri-Trapper, Skimmer, Factory, Mothership,
  the bosses' drone/trap rows): diep's knockback table predates them; each borrows its nearest
  relative's row.
- **`DOMINATOR_RETARGET_IDLE`** (3 s), **`BASE_DRONE_LEASH`** (`gu(90)`), Tag's `INVIS_FLOOR`,
  `CLOSER_COUNT 4`, Domination's Dominator layout (diamond; diep gives no coordinates) — all
  unreferenced knobs.
- **Bots** (`lib/gameAI.js`) have no path to most post-T2 tanks — not authored yet.
- **Boss travel speed** reuses Summoner's `BOSS_DRIFT` (our boss integrator has no
  `Physics.stepBody`); diep's `movementSpeed` accel term has no clean conversion into it.
- **Fallen Overlord/Booster bodies** draw as rounded rects, not tank-shaped hulls with their
  own barrels' silhouettes — plan.md Part D tightens the armament, the body shape is still a
  simplification.
- **Survival/Mothership modes**: no waiting-room countdown UI (data is on the wire), no
  per-mode front-page door art, no `shapeScoreRewardMultiplier` (×3 shapes-only XP has no hook
  in `awardXp()`), Survival's shape density doesn't rescale with the arena.

## Knowingly wrong / do-not-"fix"

- **Semi-implicit Euler drag error**: live 25 ms server runs ~1.8% over the 40 ms-reference
  steady state (362.25 → 368.9 u/s); impulse columns read ~1.8% high with it. The real fix (an
  exponential integrator) redefines every per-reference-tick constant. Recorded so nobody
  chases it; `test/rooms.js` uses a 3% band for this reason.
- **Class-tier gate** is `parseInt(level / 15)` — our level is 1-based; do not "restore" the
  `(1 + level)` form, it opens tier 1 at level 9. Pinned by `test/rooms.js`.
- **Boss aggro radius** is measured from the hull (`(raw − size) / raw`) because tanks can no
  longer stand inside a boss; the 0.5625 y-squash makes a flat subtraction wrong. Not a diep
  number (Summoner-engine specific).
- **Shape density** (+40% vs old tree) is also a per-tick cost: ffa canvas ops +56%. Knob:
  `SHAPE_DENSITY_GU2` in `rooms/Room.js`.

## Untested — nobody has watched these happen

A full match start→finish; two humans in one room; boss AI vs a live human; chat over a real
socket; packet-length validation from a real browser; several busy rooms at once; the full
signup→login round trip. Plus the standing in-browser checklist: bullets leaving the muzzle
under hard strafe, camera feel, recoil/knockback magnitudes against the grid, base-drone
behaviour around bases, each mode's win/close flow, the accounts/achievements panels. (The old
75-line expansion of this list died with the graphics rewrite plan — re-derive from plan.md's
Part F eyeball pass when the silhouettes land.)

## Tooling notes worth not rediscovering

- **`test/clientDiff.js` seeds ONE RNG across four rooms in sequence** — a change to how many
  entities exist (or how long one lives) shifts every later mode's positions. Isolate causes by
  overriding the suspect constant at load time and re-running once per candidate. Rebaseline
  deliberately, with the reason in the file header.
- **Grep for the old number, not the constant name** when a value moves. Known near-collisions:
  Gunner `speed 0.511936` vs retired `MOVE_ACCEL_BASE 0.511941`; retired impulse `0.43881` vs
  bullet `speed 0.438816` shared by eight drone/trap cannons.
- **`motion()`/`update()` replacement is a three-way pattern** — `createBoss()`, Tag's
  `createCloser()`, `createDominator()` all bind their own pair at spawn and never reach
  `Physics.stepBody`; any new entity built this way inherits that.
- **Get the `lib/tick.js` category right** — it never fails loudly. An impulse into a
  `stepBody` body is `impulse()`; into a self-integrating body (`Bullet.js`, `Objects.js`) it's
  `perTick()`.
- **A test that only compares our two halves against each other cannot catch a scale error** —
  anchor at least one assertion outside the tree (plan.md Part F).
